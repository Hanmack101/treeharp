# treeharp
simple 360 harp style project, similar to rings on a tree.
This is the readme to be edited later


This is another test change, becasue you rushed ahead on the tutorial and now you have deleted branches in github..and not on your machine. Bleugh.

This design will mean that users can run their hands through the space to hear different tones. The angle is not used, only a series of rings dictated by distance.
